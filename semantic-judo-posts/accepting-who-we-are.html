    <h1>Accepting who we are</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Accepting ourselves for who we are and being honest about what that means is incredibly difficult for just about everyone. And yet it is a powerful underlying force that impacts just about every area of our lives. It seems that loving ourselves for who we are, believing that we are loved and worthy of love is essential to living a healthy and effective life.</p>

  <p>I know I struggled with this for many years without realizing it. And it played out in life by judging myself about everything, constantly and at times desperately seeking approval, judging others sometimes harshly and sometimes without good reason. All are terrible things to go through — for the afflicted and those around them.</p>

  <p>Lack of acceptance of oneself is one underlying cause of a huge amount of psychological pain in the world which more often than not then manifests as real pain to self or others. And, as would seem logical, honestly accepting oneself is the source of a whole lot of relief and freedom and one of the starting points for living a wholehearted, effective life. I can tell you as a reformed harshest-critic-of-myself that it is a much better, much more enjoyable way to live. But not always easy to execute, for sure.</p>

  <p>Just believe that you can get there... or rather, take a growth mindset and <strong><em>know</em></strong> that you can get there regardless of how obscured the path to that place is right now.</p>
