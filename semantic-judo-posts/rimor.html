<h2>Friar Amittere</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 	<li>Mediterranean</li>
 	<li>Fit and works out regularly.</li>
 	<li>Has lived by a "healthy body, healthy mind" principle until he got wrung out by wrong in the world. He's ultra-empathetic and takes the pain of the world personally. About two years ago, started taking Laudanum to numb the pain, now addicted to opiates and on the run. One day about a year ago he's in an opium den/place of ill repute, and ODs. Dr. Surgeon is there - a regular. Others have died in the past and Dr. Surgeon did nothing. But this time he saves Friar and we never know why. Friar is indebted but also wracked with guilt and curiosity and becomes friends with Surgeon... they go on to become mercenaries together, each with their own demons and skills to help others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Commander of the Allied Warriors</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 	<li>Leads "special ops" teams made up of a variety of different cultural groups of mercenaries from around the world</li>
 	<li>We don't know his name - most people just refer to him as "Commander"</li>
 	<li>From Greenland, clean cut, multilingual</li>
 	<li>Clearly intelligent and overqualified for this low level mercenary work but thrives on making his special ops teams run highly effective operations.</li>
 	<li>If required, always has access to large amounts of money but won't talk about where it came from.</li>
 	<li>Does not talk about his past or why he chose to do this job.</li>
 	<li>"Crusaderesque"</li>
 	<li>No respect for Friar due to addiction but mutual respect with Dr. Surgeon and has no problem with his violent streak so he puts up with Friar. Hints of a past link between him and Dr. Surgeon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vysota</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 	<li>Leader of the archer units</li>

 	<li>Stocky and strong</li>

<h2>Maria Vengeance</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 	<li>Leader of Heavy Calvary units</li>
 	<li>Maria, goes by Vengence and gets angry when people call her Maria</li>
 	<li>Comes from a "Wonder Woman world" (white, northern European culture in the jungle) outcast - self imposed because she sees herself this way but this is not how her troops see her necessarily</li>
 	<li>She's large, aggressive, and beautiful but has problematic relationships with men. They're mostly scared of her. And she doesn't try to dissuade but also longs for a meaningful relationship.</li>
 	<li>Angry and prone to heavy drinking</li>
 	<li>She's got too many mental hangups to see things clearly. Plus drinking makes things cloudy. But she is unquestionably blessed at fighting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aife</h2>
<ul class="bullet-list">
 	<li>Red head Irish twin daughters of a successful, retired general</li>
 	<li>Leaders of the "Warriors"</li>
 	<li>Identities are inextricably bound together - they have the same name, making them extremely effective when they work together, especially in battle but they are both highly individualistic which commonly leads to conflict in every day life and ultimately holds them back.</li>

<h1>General art elements</h1>
Take all this as "nothing set in stone" - ideas, brainstorming. If it sounds weird, it might be but I want to think on it and explore!

Themes driving art: Pirates of the Caribbean, Seventies, neon, graphic novel

In the following image, you can see a couple of font choices plus some use of the "neon" concept in the menu on the left. Also, at least for version one, I want a dark background like this. Also, the "small", single "R" logo top left which is a play on the large logo at the top of the page.

<h2>Color palette</h2>
Not convinced I like the blue... the dark background is good plus light gray and orange. Not sure about the rest.
