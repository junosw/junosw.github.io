					It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
					or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who
					is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
					valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error
					and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms,
					the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
					triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.

			Don’t Lie to Yourself
			A powerful line from the “Elder” named Zosima in The Brothers Karamozov:
			<div class="quote">
				Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love… “Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially to yourself.

			In recent years, something has been simmering: Some call it the "Small Internet". I hesitate to call it a movement, that would imply a level of organization and intent that it does not possess. It's a disjointed group of like-minded people that recognize that the Internet has lost a certain je ne sais quoi, it has turned from a wild and creative space, into more of shopping mall. Where ever you go, you're prodded to subscribe to newsletters, to like and comment, to buy stuff.

			The formulation of the problem differs from purely aesthetic ones, to ones based on political doctrine. I prefer a humanist explanation. The measure of a website should be how well it enriches the life of – and empowers the visitor, rather how well it enriches the wallet of the website owner, especially not at the expense of the visitor's long-term interests.

			<div class="quote">
				"An unknown but certainly significant proportion of the population has almost completely given up on learning. These people seldom, if ever engage in deliberate learning and see themselves as neither competent at it nor likely to enjoy it. The social and personal cost is enormous.
				Although negative self-images can be overcome, in the life of an individual they are extremely robust and powerfully self-reinforcing. Deficiency becomes identity: "I can't learn French, I don't have an ear for languages;" "I could never be a businessman, I don't have a head for figures;"...
				If people believe firmly enough that they cannot do math, they will usually succeed in preventing themselves from doing whatever they recognize as math. The consequences of such self-sabotage is personal failure, and each failure reinforces the original belief. And such beliefs may be most insidious when held not only by individuals, but by our entire culture."
