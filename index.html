		<p>Sometimes I’m surprised by how orderly the Western world proceeds. The reality is that life is so fragile and there are so many dangers that just never seem to befall most of us.</p>

			Feeling overwhelemed and unfocused?  Try this:
			1. Am I eating enough
			2. Am I consuming too much caffeine
			3. 80/20 checklist
				1. Write down: what are the 20% of activities or people that are achieving 80%+ of the positive results, emotional states, etc.
				2. Write down: what are the 20% of activities or people that are achieving 80%+ of the negative results, emotional states, etc.
				3. What would this look like if it were easy.

			Encountering failure or setback
			• Does the failure or setback you have experienced apply to everything you have done, or just this one thing?
			• Is this failure or setback an enduring one that will affect you forever, or are its effects only temporary?
			• Is this failure or setback due solely to what you did or did not do, or were there additional factors involved?

			In a Crucial Confrontation
			* Think of other people as rational, reasonable and decent
			* Safety at risk? Mutual respect, mutual purpose
			* If you feel the other person is going to be offended, go to lengths to explain what you do and don't mean
			* Establish mutual purpose

			From Rising Strong
			* Think of other people as rational, reasonable and decent
			* Safety at risk? Mutual respect, mutual purpose
			* If you feel the other person is going to be offended, go to lengths to explain what you do and don't mean
			* Establish mutual purpose
			“If you own this story you get to write the ending.

			Dare greatly
			It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
			or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who
			is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
			valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error
			and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms,
			the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
			triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.…

		<h2>Sitting comfortably with yourself</h2>
		<p>
			With someone to be happy
			Identify two human beings in the room and just think, “I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy.”</p>
		<p>
		<p>
			Practice going first (from Tools of Titans)
			GABBY: “I always say that I’ll go first. . . . That means if I’m checking out at the store, I’ll say hello
			first. If I’m coming across somebody and make eye contact, I’ll smile first. [I wish] people would experiment
			with that in their life a little bit: Be first, because—not all times, but most times—it comes in your favor.
			The response is pretty amazing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Good partnerships: Good partnerships share vision, values and have complimentary capabilities.

			My I be free from suffering
			May I be as happy and healthy as possible to be
			May I have peace of mind

			"Don’t let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your feet;
			just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent.
			Let me put you to the test." —EPICTETUS

			"There is no scarcity in creativity. The world always needs good offerings. We cannot have to much beauty
			There is no such thing as to much wisdom and literature and story and craftsmanship. There is room for you." - Jen Hatmaker

			Don’t Lie to Yourself

			A powerful line from the “Elder” named Zosima in The Brothers Karamozov:

			“Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love… “Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially to yourself.”
