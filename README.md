            Old list of ideas:

                Writing topic idea: honesty. It's role in the human world
                Writing topic: the nuances of dispensing advice given individual vs. truly generalizable information.
                Writing idea: the whole evil in the world thing...if free will is constant and existence is variable, how does the free will theory hold up
                Software: AI that can extract stories - historical timeline. Person out, things in, audio.... hmmmmm….
                Software: simplex diet with access to APIs to relevant foods with pictures "you pick the foods and constraints, we'll create healthy meals" "random meal generator"
