		<h2 class="section-header">12 Questions</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50937.First_Break_All_the_Rules">First, Break All the Rules</a> has been on my "to read" list for quite a while and I finally got around to starting it this last weekend. I'm glad I did. The "12 questions" the first 30% of the book seems revolves around resonate strongly with me with regard to how to drive employee engagement. Enough said (for now). Here they are:</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				Do I know what is expected of me at work?
				<ul>
					<li>Do my team members have clear job descriptions, and clarity around projects, tasks and expectations.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
				<ul>
					<li>Have they got the resources they need to succeed in their role?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday?
				<ul>
					<li>Do you have people in the right jobs, where they can use and build on their strengths?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In the last 7 days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
				<ul>
					<li>When was the last time you gave praise to the individuals in your team? If it wasn't in the last week, it's not regular enough. People crave recognition - your role as leader is to encourage and cheer-lead your team.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?
				<ul>
					<li>Do you know who your team members are as people, not employees?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
				<ul>
					<li>Do you provide opportunities for your staff to learn new skills and feel like they are moving forward?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				At work, do my opinions seem to count?
				<ul>
					<li>People leave managers, not jobs. What structure do you have in place for your team members to provide their feedback? And do you listen when it's given?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Does the mission / purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
				<ul>
					<li>Do your team members know how their role fits into the bigger picture?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
				<ul>
					<li>Are you letting poor performers set the standard or are you encouraging people to lift the bar? The standard your walk past is the standard you set. Good performers can be demoralized if poor standards are accepted in others.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Do I have a best friend at work?
				<ul>
					<li>Are you providing opportunities for your team to grow supportive relationships at work? Work is a big part of their lives, so it's vital for people to have fun and friendship.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In the last 6 months, has someone talked to me about my progress?
				<ul>
					<li>Are you providing regular reviews and feedback to help people with a sense of direction at work?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				This last year, have I had the opportunity at work to learn and grow?
				<ul>
					<li>Do you provide opportunities for advancement?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
